# PlantPulse
A Plant Disease Detector made using tensorflowjs and node js

## Setup
1. Unzip and open convmod and open folders that come up until you see bin files.
2. Open terminal here and type serve -p 5000 (make sure you have http-server installed as -g from npm)
3. Next, open this folder (PlantPulse), open terminal from here and type npm install then npm run dev
4. Next, in any browser (pref. chrome) open http://localhost:3000/

## Workflow + Tech Stack

## Model 
1. Used VGG19 model as our base model from the Keras library
2. Used basic image preprocessing techniques (image size=(256,256), batch_size=32)
3. Trained it on our own dataset of size 20,600 files.
